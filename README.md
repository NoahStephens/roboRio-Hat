# The Lost Breakout Board for The NI Robo Rio
## Developed by Noah Stephens (FRC 6498 Alumni)


### This board breaks out everything on the Robo Rio and adds 
- Standard Molex Connectors
- Standard I2C Connector and Header
- RS232 Input Connector

The molex connectors are put in place to keep connectors from falling out.
